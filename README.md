# electron-webpack-quick-start
> A bare minimum project structure to get started developing with [`electron-webpack`](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-webpack).

Thanks to the power of `electron-webpack` this template comes packed with...

* Use of [`webpack-dev-server`](https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server) for development
* HMR for both `renderer` and `main` processes
* Use of [`babel-preset-env`](https://github.com/babel/babel-preset-env) that is automatically configured based on your `electron` version
* Use of [`electron-builder`](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-builder) to package and build a distributable electron application

Make sure to check out [`electron-webpack`'s documentation](https://webpack.electron.build/) for more details.

## Getting Started
Simply clone down this reposity, install dependencies, and get started on your application.

The use of the [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) package manager is **strongly** recommended, as opposed to using `npm`.

```bash
# create a directory of your choice, and copy template using curl
mkdir new-electron-webpack-project && cd new-electron-webpack-project
curl -fsSL https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-webpack-quick-start/archive/master.tar.gz | tar -xz --strip-components 1

# or copy template using git clone
git clone https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-webpack-quick-start.git
cd electron-webpack-quick-start
rm -rf .git

# install dependencies
yarn
```

### Development Scripts

```bash
# run application in development mode
yarn dev

# compile source code and create webpack output
yarn compile

# `yarn compile` & create build with electron-builder
yarn dist

# `yarn compile` & create unpacked build with electron-builder
yarn dist:dir
```

## Build on Mac and Windows



## Build on Linux

**Docker** is needed to build on Linux. It is configured to generate the following packages:

### rpm (RH/Fedora/Centos)

Unable to run directly due to failed dependencies: `libappindicator` and `libXScrnSaver`

* `sudo yum install libappindicator libXScrnSaver`
* `sudo rpm -i 'dial-desktop-0.0.0.x86_64.rpm'`

### deb (Debian/Ubuntu)

* Tested on `Ubuntu 16.04`

Unable to install directly due to missing dependencies: `libappindicator1`

To install:

* `sudo apt-get install libappindicator1`
* `sudo apt-get -f install`
* `sudo dpkg -i 'dial-desktop.deb'`

### AppImage (Universal)

Tested on `Centos 7` and `Ubuntu 16.04` and It is working.

```bash
docker run --rm -ti \
 --env-file <(env | grep -iE 'DEBUG|NODE_|ELECTRON_|YARN_|NPM_|CI|CIRCLE|TRAVIS_TAG|TRAVIS|TRAVIS_REPO_|TRAVIS_BUILD_|TRAVIS_BRANCH|TRAVIS_PULL_REQUEST_|APPVEYOR_|CSC_|GH_|GITHUB_|BT_|AWS_|STRIP|BUILD_') \
